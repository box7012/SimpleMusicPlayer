1. Simple UI
- currently just have some buttons
- Explanation
- play, pause button
- progress bar
- volume control



### **To-Be**
1. Alarming function : By checking this function, you could turn-on or turn-off whenever you want!
2. make a link about the music : maybe... you can just write down the link and it could autimatically edit and just give the cutted part (just music part maybe..)
3. Change the singer : With clicking the button written with musicians, the song would be changed into the voice of the musician
4. Editing the song : cliping(or just cutting), change the data type, etc...
5. List function : you can make your own music-list
